# Our Question
​
# We wanted to explore whether the weather in the top ten US cities by population 
# have an impact on the health of the population living there, 
# as measured in suicide rates and obesity rates per capita.

# Methods 
​
# We are obtaining historical weather data from the OpenWeather api for the top 10 US Cities.
# Weather is also available on a state by state basis. 
# Suicide Data was pulled from the FBI and Obesity Data from the CDC. 
# Suicide and obesity were selected due to the availability of data as well as the fact 
# that we wanted to use at least two health metrics to explore this question.

# Challenges 
​
# Obtaining the data in the desired format via APIs was a bit of a challenge.
# The years the data was pulled form needed to match up for us to be able to draw conclusions
# Since we were using multiple sources, not all of them had data available for the same years so 
# needed to tailor our plan accordingly. 

Proposal 

Weather/Health Outcomes 

For this project, we will explore the impact of weather on health outcomes across various geographical locations. 

Specifically, we will look at whether a relationship exists between weather and three health outcomes: 

1. Suicide Rates 
2. Mental Health*
3. Obesity 

*Need to define/quantify- depression and drug abuse rates 

Our goal is to find out whether a correlation exists between weather (sunny days, rainy days, cold days) and physical health across the US Population. 

We plan to divide the US into regions. 

Resources we plan to use include (but are not limited to):  

1. dashboard.health.gov 
2. The CDC 
3. The US Census 
4. OpenWeatherAPI

Definitions 
How are we looking at weather locations 
1. US Only
2. Cloudiness/Sunniness Category 
3. Precipitation Category 
4. Temperature 
5. Humidity 
6. All measurements are in F/inches 
7. Time period at least 5 years AVERAGE 

Pull data per state 
1. Weather data- per state as stated above 
2. Suicide rates - for each state per capita 
3. Health data- for each state obesity per capita 
4. Health data- mental health* per capita 

Jesse- Health data- exploratory to see what’s out there 
Laura - Pull weather data per state 
Alicia- Census data 

Goal: by Wednesday- be able to discuss more, by Saturday have the CSV files 

Does the weather in the top ten US cities by population  impact the health of the population, as measured in suicide rates and obesity rates per capita 

Goal: 
Laura- weather data for top 10 cities by Saturday 
Jesse and Alicia - FBI data for suicide rates and violence, cdc or other api source for obesity rates 

All rates per capita 

Years of health data to match up with weather data for the graphs 

Workflow: 
Have data from API into JSON or CSV files ready for Saturday 
We will clean data and play around with how it could graph 
Get any additional data needed to answer our question 
 
Monday
Look at ways of presenting
Finalize and do run-through of our presentation
