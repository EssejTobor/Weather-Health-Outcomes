# Weather-Health-Outcomes

For this project, we tried to explore the impact of weather on health outcomes across the ten largest cities (by population) in United States.

Specifically, we looked to see whether a relationship exists between weather and four health outcomes:

Sleep deprivation, 
Mental Health, 
Obesity, 
and Binge Drinking


Our goal was to find out whether a correlation exists between weather (sunny/rainy/cold and snow days) 
and the mental and physical health across this US Population.


Resources used include:
